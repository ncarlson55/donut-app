# Nucamp React Honor Project

Hi, my name is Nico Carlson and this is my frontend ui ecommerce app built with react!

The inspiration behind the app was that before I started the Nucamp Coding Bootcamp, as a side hustle, I ran a donut-delivery business in my small town! About 99 percent of my business came through facebook. I knew relying on social media for business could hurt me, so I wanted to build a website people can place their order. 

### Built with
-React: Relied heavily on Material UI and Reactstrap for the layouts and the icons. I was thinking mobile-first because most of my previous customers made the orders on their phone. I also found a notification library called Tostify that had small pop-up notifications when users add items to the cart.

## The challenge
- I wanted to learn Material UI and I underestimated how much time I needed to learn, especially the makeStyles process that Material UI uses. 
- I hate to admit it but I struggled with writing functions for adding and removing cart items. I watched several different videos of developers showing how they used functions to add and remove items to the cart, as well reading through several Stack Overflow solutions.
- I had to change libraries a couple of times because I initially was using React Bootstrap and it was crashing my project. 

### What I learned
- Even the I didn't style the UI and it is a relatively simple, basic project, I really enjoyed actually building something that I can call my own. Learning how to Google can be its own study! 
- This project also reinforced 

### Continued development
- I plan to continue building depth of knowledge in the React ecosystem. I enjoyed seeing React can take data and render functional UI elements with relative ease and I am going to build more projects with React.
- I now see the importance of state management for React. I found myself working on state for a component and then realizing I need this state for other components and had to go through that process of lifting state up to my App.js file. Redux was challenging to learn during the bootcamp but I feel its fundamental to learn as these projects start to scale.
- Because I struggled with coming writing functions on my own, I plan learning more about algorithms and practice writing functions. I feel like this will of great importance going forward in my career. 
- Designing ended up being my krytonite. I realized having good wireframes/mockups helps breakdown the project into smaller pieces, which I believe would have been alot easier to code. I found a community called Frontend Mentor that will help with that process.
